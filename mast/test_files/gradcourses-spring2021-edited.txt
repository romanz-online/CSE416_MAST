AAS  555: Heritage Languages of AsianAmericans
English has long been the dominant languageused in the United States, while the languagesof numerous indigenous and immigrantcommunities have declined and manyhave died. At the same time, the UnitedStates. extensive global role, the risinggeopolitical rise of Asian powers, such asChina, India, Japan, South Korean, and othershas highlighted the need to foster greaterAsian language and cultural skills amongAmericans. In that context, maintainingthe existing diversity of languages spokenamong American immigrant populationsbecomes as important and effective asteaching the languages to new populations.There is an increasing recognition that theadvantages of such multilingualism are notonly cultural, but also cognitive, diplomatic,security, commercial, social, and politicalas well. Retaining knowledge of the homelanguage is found to promote the minorityindividuals. psychological well-being,facilitate communication and bonding acrossgenerations, and ease the process of adjustingto life away from the home country, whilepromoting a pluralistic outlook and providingglobally valuable job skills. Still, the bruntof the actual effort to foster multilingualismhas been left to individual families despite theknown fact that parental effort at maintenancealone are not enough to prevent an eventualshift to English. This new course is a criticalexamination of the nature and extent ofavailable support (institutional, social, family,and other) for maintaining this valuableresource of Asian immigrants languages.Students learn through through in-depthreadings, class lectures and discusssions, anddirected research in language communities oftheir choice.

AAS  565: Food, Labor and AsianAmerica
.An authentic taste of Asia. is a marketingphrase haunted by the violent histories ofOrientalism, Western expansion and wars inAsia. In truth, the success and popularity ofsome Asian food is more than the celebrationof the immigrant work ethic. Behind thepopularity are geopolitical and labor issues.The consumption of beef and poultry in theU.S., for example, is intimately connectedto the exploitation of immigrants from theglobal south. Undocumented immigrantsand refugees from Southeast Asia, EastAfrica and the Americas perform the dirtytask of slaughtering millions of animals:chickens, turkeys, pigs, ducks, sheep, lamb,calves. In 2009 alone, 33,300,000 cattle werekilled for their meat in the United States.Immigrant laborers of American industrialslaughterhouses carry out dirty and dangerouswork, killing and dismembering animals evenas the laborers themselves live in crowded,unsanitary quarters. Similarly, the cooks ofAmerica.s kitchens are immigrants from Asiaand other parts of the world. This new MAcourse focuses on the emerging field knownas .food studies,. in particular the politics andhistories of Asian food and its popularity in theUnited States. If the old adage is .we are whatwe eat,. what does it mean that Asian food inthe U.S. is intimately connected to the historiesof wars in Asia, undocumented labor, and theexploitation of immigrant food workers?

AFS  504: Racialized Oppressions andthe Idea of Humanity
When one reads accounts of slavery, genocide,the systematic denial of rights to a groupbecause of a racial identity, the questionalways arises whether the oppressors view theracialized other as fully human? This coursewill explore this question and what it means toview an individual or group as "fully human."How have philosophical understandings of themoral importance and the moral meaning of"humanity" served to exacerbate, moderateor fight against racial oppression? How doesracial and gender oppression compare in thisrespect? Is there a comparison to be madebetween racial oppression and the treatmentaccorded to disabled people with respect to theunderstanding of what it is to be human? Doesshifting the ground from a biologically-basedconcept such as "humanity" to a philosophicalconcept of "personhood" serve to justify orserve as a tool against these identity-basedoppressions? Does shifting the ground justifythe analogy of racism with the abuse ofanimals, as in the idea of "speciesism"? Wewill explore as many of these questions asinterest dictates and time permits.

EST  690: Seminar in Theory Building
Science is about discovering facts as wellas explaining what the facts mean. Theoriesprovide explanations and interpretationsof empirical phenomena and building andmodifying theories are at the heart of corescientific activities. Good theory is essentialto many new fields for several reasons.First, good theory provides guidance forpractical action and therefore should beat the foundation of curricula. Second,without good theory in any particular field,researchers must borrow theories from otheracademic disciplines. While this can beuseful, sometimes these theories might not fitour subject matter well. For example socialtheories based on behavioral assumptionsstemming from non-digital communications donot fully address substantive features of socialbehavior in a digital age. Research coursescommonly emphasize empirical researchmethods and formal modeling approachesto theory development. There is much lessguidance for those who want to build a theoryfor managerial and behavioral studies-Yetevery researcher must do so to develop agood research proposal. This seminar aimsto fill that gap by focusing on theory typesand evaluation criteria, theory developmentprocesses, and theoretical writing.

Offered in Spring, 3 credits, Letter graded (A,A-, B+, etc.)

HCB  510: Literature, Compassion, andMedical Care
How does literature help us understandthe nature of human illness and suffering?Can written works of art, ancient andcontemporary, that depict moments ofcompassion and compassionate acts laybare the moral, spiritual, psychological, andphysical reality of suffering? There is a longassociation between literature and medicine,from the viewpoint of physician-writers,such as Anton Checkov and William CarlosWilliams, whose literary skills have eclipsedtheir medical backgrounds. Sherlock Holmesand Doctor Watson were the creations ofa physician-writer, Arthur Conan Doyle.Physicians portrayed in literature, such as Dr.Bernard Rieux, in Albert Camus The Plague,have also explored the relationship betweenpatient and doctor, the nature of healing.This semester-long course will study theserelationships through reading of poetry, drama,fiction, memoir, and essay and reflect on thenature of suffering, the intrinsic human needfor compassion, and the implications for healthand healing.

HCB  511: Bioethics, Disability &Community
Most people will experience disability at somepoint in their lives, and for some it will shapetheir social, personal, family, educational,and employment experiences. Viewpointson disabilities which have emerged in policyand the broader culture have been explicitlychallenged by emerging communities ofpeople with disabilities who seek to speakfor themselves and claim full inclusion insociety. In this context, bioethicists anddisability scholars have found points ofboth common cause and stark disagreementover issues such as neonatal and end-of-lifecare, the value and values inherent medicaldecisions and their outcomes. These bioethicaldebates occur in the context of debates overthe rights of individuals with disabilitiesto self-determination, accommodations forwork and schooling, and the potential forpeople with disabilities to make uniquecontributions because of--rather than despite--their disabilities.

Bioethics is an American invention. Ideasabout medicine and morality, of course, goback to antiquity and are documented asmedical ethics in Europe, medical morality inChina, and under many other names in culturesaround the world. Recently, the process ofglobalization of ideas, medical practices,clinical trials, and migration of patients hasled to clashes of culture around issues such asthe appropriate standards and control groupsfor clinical trials, organ transplantation, braindeath, and end-of-life care. Issues of religion,morality, public policy, disability rightsand policy, and health system structure andpayment all shape how particular societiesdecide to manage divisive issues such as thebeginning and end of life.

PHY  689: Special Topics in AcceleratorPhysics
Recently we established the Center forAccelerator Physics with Vladimir Litvinenkoappointed as Director (with a sharedappointment at BNL), and with a secondfaculty position in accelerator physics beingadded in the near future, we expect that thenumber of students working on acceleratorphysics will increase significantly and therewill be much more demand for courses inthis area. For a long time accelerator physicscourses have been taught as "PHY 584:Special Topics in Nuclear Physics", but thisis improper use of the course listing. Thepurpose of this course is two-fold. First, itis a special topic course that is taught fulltime at Stony Brook. Second, it is specialtopics course which is taught in collaborationwith the United States Particle AcceleratorSchool (USPAS), which is taught on a rotatingbasis at various universities and NationalLaboratories in the US. If that is the case,students will prepare for the USPAS courseduring the semester, and will particioate inthe USPAS school in the following Winteror Summer break. The grade for the coursewill be determined by the grade in the USPASschool. Funding to participate in the USPAScourse will be provided by USPAS if studentsare registered for such course at their localuniversity.

POL  563: Thinking and Emotion inPublic Opinion
This course reviews recent research incognitive, social, and political psychology onthe interplay between cognition and emotionin explaining social and political behavior.Traditionally, political science has viewedthinking as a conscious cognitive processof intentional deliberation. Emotions andother feelings have been ignored or seen asinterfering with rational though. Moreover,until recently there has been almost noconsideration of what psychologists callimplicit or unconscious thought processes inunderstanding public opinion. Psychologistsand communications researchers nowunderstand that implicit events and processes(e.g., symbol or music cues in politicaladvertising) can have profound effects onhow citizens evaluate political candidates,groups, and issues. We will examine thetraditional approach to political cognition andconsider how this recent research may alterour understanding of the formation of publicopinion.

POL  565: Persuasion and Propaganda
Politics at its core is about persuasion. Itis about argumentation and debate, andabout bringing citizens to a particular wayof thinking about an issue, candidacy, orevent. Given its centrality in the politicalprocess, understanding the dynamics ofpolitical persuasion should be a high priorityfor the discipline. In a more theoretical vein,the concept of "attitude" is among the mostindispensable in the social sciences. Thiscourse is intended to provide a survey ofcontemporary theory and research on attitudeformation and change. It is not intended tobe a general course on the mass media, butrather is concerned only with mass mediaresearch as it pertains to individual-levelpolitical attitude processes. The course isdivided into the following three sections: (1)A consideration of basic concepts (e.g., whatis an "attitude"), methodological challenge,and recent developments (e.g., the distinctionbetween implicit and explicit attitudes); (2)An overview of major psychological theoriesof persuasion that attempt to answer HaroldLasswell's classic question: Who says what, inwhich channel, to whom, and with what effect?(3) An examination of the major agents ofpolitical persuasion - the mass media, politicalelites, social context, and interpersonalprocesses.

We then explore the strengths andweaknesses of paradigm shifts to values,buttressed by public opinion data. Bringing incultural and neo-institutional explanations ofpolitical behavior and change, the course wedsindividual level analysis and group behaviortheories with rigorous empirical testing. Wewill look at cross-national and longitudinaldata sets to examine the evolving politicalspace stemming from new politics, identitypolitics, immigration, and "new security"threats in a global era. Finally, the course willconclude by looking at how different levels ofanalyses (individual, group, and institutions)contribute to explain contentious politics,`boundary-making ("us" and "them"), and the`politics of difference across cultures.
